Thanks to this script, you can install Rustdesk software unattended.

If you have your own Rustdesk Server, you must specify your server's ip/domain and key information in the script file. So after installation Rustdesk software will automatically connect to your server.

If you do not have a Rustdesk Server, you can install without making any changes, in this case the Rustdesk software will install in its default settings.
